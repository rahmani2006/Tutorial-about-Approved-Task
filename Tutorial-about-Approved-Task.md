I am Alsa Rahmani from Herat, Afghanistan. I have participated in the Google Code-in competition in 2019. It is an opportunity and the best way to motivate students with open source software development. For more complete info, see https://codein.withgoogle.com/about/. 
As we have electricity and internet problems in our country so it was too hard to submit the task on time but I try many times and fortunately submit tasks successfully so you can do it too so hurry up and don't miss it.  
I just explain one task which I have already finished with the name of  [HTML/CSS Creating a webpage task](https://codein.withgoogle.com/tasks/6580605970546688/?sp-is_beginner=False&sp-categories=1&sp-categories=2&sp-search=write%20a%20tutorial). 
I hope my experience helps others to submit their task successfully.
